Position of the Corporation in Pharmaceutical Industry 9.1.Position of the Corporation in Pharmaceutical Industry
At the present, the major activities of the Corporation is to invest in pharmaceutical affiliates, including biggest firms in domestic pharmaceutical industry.
Many of the Corporation’s affiliates have strong financial capacity, wide distribution network and high technology GMP factories.
At present, Vietnam Pharmaceutical Corporation is one of only 3 entities nationwide permitted by Ministry of Health to conduct BE research.
The Corportion’s study capacity is about 20 researches per year.
In addition, the Corporation is the organization conducting missions of Ministryof Health to provide medicines in emergency cases (disasters, widespread diseases).
In the period of 2015 – 2020, the Corporation intends to invest in essential projects of pharmaceutical industry such as research and development in pharmaceutical science and technology, developing herbal pharmaceutical areas, producing pharmaceutical materials, health care… The Corporation will gradually make Vinapharm become one of the most successful brands in Vietnam in pharmaceutical sector and relevance.
9.2.Pharmaceutical Industry Prospect 9.2.1.
Global Pharmaceutical Industry
According to WHO, average growth rate of the global pharmaceutical industry is 3.1%, Statista Company’s forecast of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) until 2016 of pharmaceutical industry in regions is illustrated in the below figure, Asia Pacific region has the highest growth rate of about 6.1%, whereas emerging market has the growth rate of 6%.
IPO PROSPECTUS
Source: Statista Company 2015
In the period of 2014 – 2018, as measured by Evaluate Pharma, global medicine expenditure will reach USD 900 billion in 2018.
Revenue of prescription medicine will reach USD 1,000 billion; revenue of biologicals will account for 52% in Top 100 prescription medicines and OTC, and will account for 27% of the global market in 2020.
Global Research and Development field (R&D) in 2015 forecast by Industry Standard Research Company includes: Research and Development USD 251 billion, Market development USD 101.4 billion, Research Phase I-IV USD 72.3 billion, and Clinical research USD 25.6 billion, Technavio Company projects Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of clinical research will be 8.1% in the period of 2014 – 2019.
Source: Industry Standard Research Company
Expense of pharmaceutical research and development is very high, According to Deloitte and Thomson Reuters’ examination, at the end of 2013 expense of creating one new medicine is USD 1.3 billion.
Producers, therefore, have tendency to move clinical research phase to developing countries.
IPO PROSPECTUS 9.2.2.
The Vietnam Pharmaceutical Industry
The Vietnam pharmaceutical industry currently stands at level 3 on the scale of WHO, In addition, on the five-level scale of UNIDO, Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry is at level 3, meaning ‘domestic pharmaceutical industryproduce almost medicine fromimport materials’.
Pharmaceutical industry has not been well organized, only produced generic medicine (which are , lost special medicine segment to foreign companies.
According to IMS’s health statistics, Vietnam is one of the countries that use the highest amount of generics medicine, especially in hospitals in general and state-owned hospitals in particular.
Project ‘Vietnamese people prefer Vietnamese medicine’ has been passed by the minister of Ministry of Health, which facilitates medicine producers to improve capability and revenue, per capital medicine expenditure in Vietnam in 2015 was USD 37.97.
In IMS’s perspective, Vietnam is categorized into Group 2 of Level 3 (per capital medicine expenditure below USD 85).
The group contains 9 countrieswhich are Vietnam, South Africa, Algeria, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, Nigeria and Ukraine.
Regarding law and regulation, Pharmaceutical Law (amended) has been approved by the National Assembly and shall come into effect from 1 July 2017.
Activities in pharmaceutical industry will be considerably affected as soon as the law is imposed.
a. Clinical Research and Bioequivalence
Clinical research is one phase in the process of research and development (R&D) of one new medicine.
Legal environment is not stable, and expense of inventing new medicine is relatively very high in comparision with size of Vietnam companies (Expense for one research approximately equals to Vietnam’s medicine expenditure in 2014).
Thus, Vietnam only can conduct clinical research (Contract Research Organizer – CRO) in Vietnam.
At the moment, there is no organization or company in Vietnam renderting clinical research.
The two foreign companies implementing the service, Quintiles Vietnam Limited Company and FHI, are facing difficulties because the service has not been regulated in Vietnam’s law and regulation.
As stipulated in Circular 08/2010/TT-BYT in respect of guiding filing reports of bioequivalence and bioavailability, Ministry of Health requires evaluating bioequivalence of 12 substances and special producing medicines (targetted release medicine, sustained release medicine).
As stated in the process of matching regulation among ASEAN countries, number of active ingredients required to be evaluated BA/BE will increase to around 30 by 2020.
According to national pharmaceutical industry strategy, there is 40% generic medicines (domestic producing and import) that have had registration number has been evaluated BA/BE by 2020.
Currently, Vietnam has approximately 3000 generic medicines that has registration number, including 2000 domestic producing medicines.
However, there is only 3 entities nationwide permitted by Ministry of Health to conduct BE research, including Vietnam Pharmaceutical Corporation with the capacity of 20 researches/year, BE research capacity of
IPO PROSPECTUS the other two entities (National Institute of Drug Quality Control, Institute of Drug Quality Control in Ho Chi Minh City) is 80 researches/year.
From now to 2020, number of companies conducting BA/BE research will not increase a lot because BA/BE research requires a long time to train employees and specific regulations of BA/BE research have not yet been released (tentatively released in the period of 2017 – 2018 after imposition of Adjusted Pharmaceutical Law).
From now to 2020, research supply may not meet the requirement of pharmaceutical industry.
Therefore, expanding investment and improving the capacity of BA/BE research of the Corporation are very important and potential.
b. Dispensing Research
Currently, all production companies have department of product research and development, Some companies have implemented successfully strategy of product research and development, Some other companies, however, only implement simple dispensing and have not yet had specific strategies due to lack of necessary infrastructure and lack of qualified employees.
Licensing activities have happened in Vietnam, but only at small size.
c. Production
The Vietnam domestic production scale accounts for 77% on quantity but only 35% on value.
The production industry focus on medicine catergory that have low value and simple formula.
The domestic product’s market share has slowly increased and been difficult to achieved the government goal of 80% in 2020.
The domestic medicine production in 2013-2015 has been estimated at USD 1.3 billion, USD 1.39 and USD 1.65 billion respectively; including USD 150 million of medicine export in 2015.
Many domestic pharmaceutical manufactures have a trend on enhancing their factories into international standard such as PIC/S-GMP, EU-GMP to produce high quality generic mecdicines in order to increase their abilities to win the ETC channel bids and to expand export market.
Medicine outsource and franchise are the shortest and most efficient path to Vietnamese pharmaceutical enterprises on learning know-how from and catching up international pharmaceutical firms.
A research by KMPG in Vietnam market showed that the pharmaceutical industry is one of the five industries that are attractive to M &A activities in comming five years.

According to Business Monitor International (BMI), the avarage growth rate of pharmaceutical industry in Vietnam in 2015-2018 period is estimated to be 16%/year, with the revenue of 3.5-5 billion USD in 2015.
According to the General Department of Vietnam Customs, in 2015 the import of pharmaceutical products reached 2.3 billion USD, increases 14% in comparison to 2014.
Notably, in the first two months of 2016, import of pharmaceutical products of the whole country reaches 375 million USD, increases 47% in comparision to the same period of the last year.
In reality, the imported pharmaceutical products overwhelms domestic ones.
According to the figured issued by the Ministry of Health, imported drugs comprise about 60% of the total amount consumed in Vietnam.
The major pharmcaeutical import markets are European countries such as France, Germany, England, Italy, and other 2 other big markets including US and India.
Ministry of Health reveals that pharmaceutical production enterprises located mainly in two big cities including Ho Chi Minh City (50%) and hanoi (30%) and the remaining 20% are enterprises located in An Giang, Can Tho, Nam Dinh, Phu Yen …
The fact that Vietnam entered TPP also have active impacts on the pharmaceutical industry.
The major elements influance pharmaceutical industry include competitive level, taxes and intellectual property regulations in the use of generics.
Besides, domestic pharmaceutical enterprises also have oppotunities to expand their business and strengthern technology transfer.
d.	Distribution
At the end of 2015, distribution systemof Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industryis as follow:
Number of GSP export	174
Number of GSP storage	3
Number of GDP wholesales
Number of Retail sales
Where:

Major companies providing storage/logistic services include Diethelm (Switzertland), Zuellig Pharma (Singapore), Hoang Duc Pharmaceutical & Medical Supplies Co, (Vietnam), Center Pharmaceutical Company No.1, Mega Product (Thailand), Center Pharmaceutical Company No.2.
As stated in IMS’s inspection, prices of popular original medicines and state-protected medicines in Vietnam stand at one of the lowest levels among ASEAN countries (at almost treatment areas).
Unfortunately, distribution system with a lot of intermediaries increses selling price to Vietnamese customers.
The issue can be improved by facilitating professional distributors’ activities in dosmestic market.
Export and import, and distribution segments currently have intensive competitiveness, As regulated in the new Reverse Auction Law, there are national and provincial reverse auctions, Reverse auction in large size needs companies that have strong financial capability to distribute medicines in one province or in the wholde country.
The market is splitted whereas import generic medicines from Asia countries accouts for a major proportion.
e. Supporting Industries
Chemical pharmaceutical and packing:
 Material, excipient: Materials and excipients for production of domestic producer are mostly imported.
Import resources are usually available but the prices are very high.
In addition, import companies must tolerate risk of foreign exchange rate volatility.
 Herbal pharmaceutical: Even though the Government had policies supporting development and quality control of herbal pharmaceutical, at the present, the planning of developing herbal pharmaceutical areas has not officially implemented.
There is few number of herbal pharmaceuticals meeting GACP standard.
Besides, Vietnam has not yet had herbal pharmaceutical processing factory that satisfying GMP.
 Packing: As regulated by Ministry of Health, packing level 1 (packing covers directly medicines) must be produced by GMP manafacturers (Circular 14/2012/TT-BYT dated 31/08/2012 regulating standards ‘Good pharmaceutical packing manufacturing
IPO PROSPECTUS practice’ and guidances).
Vietnamcurrentlyonlyhas 01 GMP pharmaceutical packing factory that accounts for few percent of domestic companies’ demand.
Almost leve-1 packings are imported.
Investment a GMP pharmaceutical packing factory only requires medium capital and normal qualification of employees.
Machines and technology:
Vietnamese companies could produce, assemble some machines used in pharmaceutical industry.
There is currently no statistics regarding production capacity of these companies.
Human resources
According to statistics of Drug Administration of Vietnam, as of 31/12/2010 the country had 15,150 graduate- and postgraduate- university pharmacists (excluding human resources from training centers authoried by Ministry of Health).
Current number of pharmacists has not yet met the demand of pharmaceutical companies.
It is difficult to hire employees having pharmacist qualification or above, especially in provinces outside 3 big cities: Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Danang.
9.3.Evaluating the Match of the Corporation’s Development Strategy with the Industry’s Strategy, Government Policies and Global Trend
Until 2020, the Corporation will focus on five sectors: i) Research and development science and technology (consisting of research BA/BE); ii) Render marketing and selling services; iii) Warehouse service and logistics; iv) Produce medicines with high technology, and v) Producing and distributing materials, herbal pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical packages.
The Corporation’s investment direction in projects in pharmaceutical industry matches National strategy of developing Vietnam pharmaceutical until 2020 and vision to 2030 of the government.
In addition, it supports exploration of potentials to develop pharmaceutial production in Vietnam.
The Corporation’s investment direction into herbal pharmaceutical areas and extracting herbal pharmaceuticals matches the global trend towards natural pharmaceutical products which have less sides effects on patients and do not harm environment.

In the period of 2016 – 2020, the Corporation continues to manage investment in pharmaceutical subsidiaries and carry out solutions to cooperate efficiently among the Corporation and all subsidiaries.
In addition, the Corporation will develop projects in pharmaceutical industry matching national development strategy of Vietnam pharmaceutical industry for the period until 2020 and vision until 2030 of the Government; focusing on potential areas of Vietnam such as BA/BE research, herbal pharmaceutical development, and high-technology medicine production.
Projects in the period of 2016 – 2020:
i. Center of Research and development in pharmaceutical science and technology
Product research and development (R&D) in general and clinical research and BA/BE research in particular have not yet met requirements of pharmaceutical industry.
Currently, there is no organization or company of Vietnam that conduct clinical research services.
Besides, there are just three entities permitted by Ministry of Health to conduct BA/BE research, which are Vietnam Pharmaceutical Corporation, National institute of drug quality control,and Institute of drug qualitycontrol of Ho Chi Minh City.Because of BA/BE research project requires intensive capital investment and a long period for training technique experts, the project of ‘Center of Research and development in pharmaceutical science and technology’ is very necessary.
After finishing construction and starting operation, the project will satisfy the industry’s requirement of research and development in science and technology, implement process of
IPO PROSPECTUS
research BA/BE in medicine registration, follow regional and international integration process, contribute to improving quality of domestic medicines.
Healthcare clinic
When testing new medicines on people in BA/BE and clinical research, it is essential to own a healthcare clinic.
Besides, the project matches equitization polices regarding healthcare services giving increasing demand fromresidents.The Corporation plans to build a healthcare clinic for the following purposes: (1) Check, cure, and care for patients, (2) Contribute to improve market share of domestic medical producer in general and subsidiaries of the Corporation in particular, (3) Facilitate activities of Center of Research and development in pharmaceutical science and technology.
iii.
Herbal pharmaceutical area and herbal pharmaceutical extraction factory
According to the goal of the Project “Overall planning of herbal pharmaceutical development until 2020 and vision to 2030”, almost Vietnamese people will use herbal pharmaceutical for health care purposes.
Demand for herbal pharmaceutical is increasing, and more and more companies are involved in making products containing herbal pharmaceutical.
Meanwhile, amount of herbal pharmaceutical in Vietnam is dramatically decreasing due to extremely exploiting and lack of preservation and planting, In Vietnam, there is no direction in exploiting herbal pharmaceutical, which causes spontaneous exploiting, unstable harvests, and volatile prices.
Herbal pharmaceutical from domestic sources only fulfills 10 – 20% of domestic demand; the other consuming amount has been imported from China with unstainable quality.
The Corporation intends to develop huge herbal pharmaceutical area (approximately 30,000 ha) meeting GACP standard and 01 herbal pharmaceutical processing factory meeting GMP standard.
The GACP herbal pharmaceutical area and the GMP herbal pharmaceutical processing factory will produce material from standardized nature sources, create standardized production chain (from planting, harvesting, producing materials, dispensing) in order to make high and sustainable quality products.
In addition, the Project will support preserving and developing important herbal pharmaceutical genes, develop national brand herbal pharmaceutical products, and create a large amount of jobs.
Medicine material factory
According to Decision No, 68/QD-TTg dated 10/01/2014 of Prime Minister permitted “National strategy of Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry development until 2020 and vision to 2030”, the target until 2020 is that domestic production fulfills 20% of medicine material demand.
At the moment, domestic production meets only 10% material demand, Various materials (capsule, chemical pharmaceutical…) and excipients consumed by domestic producers are mainly imported, Although there are sufficient import sources, domestic producers tolerate high prices and volatility of foreign exchange rate.
The medicine material factory has potential clients which are the Corporation’s subsidiaries.
In addition, the Corporation will have the strategy to develop market share
IPO PROSPECTUS
towards other pharmaceutical producers nationwide.
Therefore, investment in the medicine material factory is such a potential project.
The project would provide domestic producers a sufficient amount of medicine materials, which follows the goal of developing pharmaceutical industry stated by the Decision of the Prime Minister.
Also, the project would create a large quantity of job vacancies.
v. Specialist medicine factory
Size of domestic producing medicines accounts for 77% of quantity, but only accounts for 35% of total value of consumed medicines.
Domestic production focuses on aging, low value and simple medicines.
Market share of domestic producing medicines is increasing very slowly, and it might not reach the target 80% in 2020 of the government.
Currently in Vietnam, medicine producers often produce generic products.
Production of specialist medicines is still below consuming needs of local people.
At the result, the Corporation will invest in a GMP (PIC/S-GMP, EU-GMP) medicine producing factory in order to cooperate with parties to transfer technology, produce original medicines under franchise, medicines in copyright period and specialist medicines (such as medicines for diabetic, cancer, heart disease patients, etc).
The project would increase supply of specialist medicines, decrease the monopoly of foreign producers, shorten needed time to assess new medicines, reduce cost of goods sold, meet treatment demand of people with reasonable prices, follow the program “Vietnamese people prefer to use medicines produced in Vietnam”.
Pharmaceutical packaging factory
In Vietnam, there is currently only 01 pharmaceutical packaging factory meeting GMP standard.
This factory has just provided a small portion of domestic production.
Almost level 1 packaging must be imported.
The Corporation, thus, immediately conducts the project to exploit domestic market,
Besides creating a large amount of job, the project would satisfy domestic demand of GMP packaging, step by step replace import packaging, obey the process of applying packaging standard of Ministry of Health into producing medicines (especially packaging directly cover medicines), and maintain the stability of medicines.
vii.Storage and logistics services
The Corporation and subsidiaries lack a pharmaceutical distribution system that meets quality standards and gather member companies.
The project, therefore, is essential for the sustainable development of the Corporation and subsidiaries.
In addition, the project would help to supply medicines to people timely, provide medicines to national and local auction programs, and provide medicines in emergency circumstances such as calamity, spread of disease…

Notes for financial figures 2016 - 2020:
During the first 3 years after equitization from 2016 to 2018, the Corporation directs its resources into new projects so that income fromfinancial investments will lower.
The projects will be at the inception, therefore, their profit contribution into the Corporation’s total profit will be moderate.
In the period of 2019 – 2020, the projects would have just completed construction period and begun operating, so that they would only generate revenue but no profit.
As a consequence, the Corporation’s profit would go down, and dividend ratio would decrease from 3% to 2%.
From 2021 on, operation of the projects would become stable and make profit increasingly.
Therefore, revenue and profit of the Corporation would grow sustainability, and dividend ratio would be mproved.
Major Assumptions:
a, Income from financial investments (dividend) is estimated as VND 70 billion (average dividend income of the last 02 years 2013 and 2014).
b, Revenue and profit from real estate business: After completion of the equitazion, the Corportion will have detail plans to the 178 Dien Bien Phu project and the 60B Nguyen Huy Tuong project:
IPO PROSPECTUS
- The project in 178 Dien Bien Phu street is estimated to be finished and operate from 2017 on with revenue of VND 5.4 billion/year, profit of VND 3.6 billion/year (approved by Board of Directors),

8.00%	8.23%	8.46%
7.00%	6.78%	6.68% 6.00%                                                          6.31%                                                 5.89%                                                 5.98%

Economic growth is the most important factor.
It depends on the growth of production and demand.
As a necessary product, pharmaceutical industry is highly stable and less affected by the fluctuation of economic growth than other industry.
GDP growth of Vietnam fell to low level and highly fluctuated during period	2008 – 2012, because of the financial crisis in US, the public debt crisis in Europe and the crash of local real estate market.
In 2013 and 2014, Vietnam’s GDP remained at low level but more sustainability thank to the effective measures of curbing inflation and restructuring commercial bank’s bad debt.
In 2015, GDP growth was 6.68% and this number is estimated to be 6,7% in 2016.
Along with the steady growth of GDP and corporates in general, Vinapharm’s business activities will be better.

Vietnam inflation rate in the period 2007-2011 highly fluctuated.
In particular, the inflation rate in 2008 and 2011 were at very high rate, 19.89% and 18.13% respectively.
Thank to the synchronization solution of Government and State Bank, inflation rate in period 2012-2014 was stable at low level, basic evarage inflation rate in 2015 increse 2.05% in comparison to the last year.

In the period 2012 – 2014, thanks to the regulation of the exchange rate trading band and the measures to closely manage the foreign currency trade, the exchange rate had remained stable.
However, in May 2015 due to the devaluation 4.4% of the China yuan and subsequently currency devaluation of the Malaysia and Thailand, Vietnam State Bank had to increase the exchange rate of 1% and loosen trading band from 1% to 3% in order to defend the export and trading deficit.This increasing exchange rate would impact to the Vinapharm’s operation.
