I. 	RISK FACTORS
Offering Risks
With such gloomy world and regional securities markets, the issuance of the Company might face a big residue of stocks.
However, with a reasonable offering method and price (at face value of VND10,000), with the prestige and good business results of the Company as well as its ongoing projects, we believe in a successful issuance, in which the shares will be sold out.
In case of residue, the Board of Directors (BoD) will find suitable solutions and continue to directly offer to others at the issuing price without more preferences than the existing shareholders.
Thus, there are hardly any offering risks.
Stock Dilution Risks
After the Company issues additional shares, the volume of outstanding shares of the Company will increase against the existing number of shares.
The increase in the number of outstanding shares and the number of shareholders of the Company will result in a stock dilution, which may cause 3 impacts:
The earnings per share (EPS) may be reduced due to the division of income into a bigger volume of shares.
The EPS is calculated as follows:
Profit (Loss) allocated to shareholders owning ordinary shares
EPS 	=
Average Outstanding Shares
However, whether EPS is reduced or not depends on the efficiency of the proceeds from this issuance to supplement its business plans.
The book value per share might be impacted upon the issuance of additional shares, which results in the increase of outstanding shares.
Book value of a 	Owner’s equity – Budget and other funds
share 	Issued shares – Treasury Stocks
Technical revision to the Company’ share price on the market: The Company’s shares are currently listed on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange.
Thus, all the information relating to the issuance of shares, such as the volume of shares issued, offering objects, asking price... will make the share price technically revised to a particular extent.
Investors can refer to the following technical revision formula of share price:
Pt-1 + ( I x PR)
P 	=
1 + I
P: market price of the share after dilution
Pt-1: market price of the share before dilution
I: Proportion of capital increase
PR: price of the share to be applied for those who holding share purchase right in the new issuance
The revision to share price of Vincom JSC after the payment of dividends by shares at the ratio of 1,000:601 and the issuance of additional shares to existing shareholders at the ratio of 1,000:202 will be calculated as follows:
For example, if the closing price of VIC shares on the day preceding to the ex-dividend date is VND100,000/share, the technically revised price on the ex-dividend date will be calculated as follows:
100,000 + ( 0.202 x 10,000 + 0.601 x 0)
P 	= 	= 	56,583.48
1 + 0.803
The price is consequently reduced by approximately 43.42%.
In the case of the issuance of additional shares for capital increase, when the offering beneficiaries are existing shareholders only, the risk of smaller proportion of ownership or voting rights of existing shareholders does not exit.
However, other indirect impacts of the issuance which result in a share dilution are still potential and will, to some extent, either directly or indirectly impact the Company shareholders’ benefits.
These risks can be limited if the Company optimizes its proceeds and maintain a good business operation after the issuance.
As per the detailed information provided in the section 10.3.c on other financial activities, Vincom JSC has issued USD100million convertible bonds.
Bond holders can convert their bonds to shares from 30 April 2010, which can be a risks causing the considerable increase of outstanding shares.
However, the initial converting price will be adjusted to mitigate the impacts on the price of outstanding shares.
Details of the adjustment to the bond conversion price are available in the enclosed appendix.
Economic Risks
Although the global economic crisis has made considerable impacts on the growth of developing countries like Vietnam, in an assessment by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Vietnam is still ranked third (preceded by China and India and followed by Russia, Thailand, Brazil) in business and production potential in the medium term thanks to: its good location for diversifying investments, inexpensive high quality labor source, good development potential of domestic market, and plentiful labor resource for the assembly industry.
Additionally, the population growth and the urbanization level will boost the strong growth in demands for accommodation, offices for lease and retail centers, creating great development potential for office and apartment projects as well as real estate management market.
As per the Decision of the Government approving the housing development orientation by 2020, the per capita residing floor area must be 15m2 in 2010 and 20m2 in 2020, the housing quality must meet national standards.
The Decision will serve as a big encouragement to the development of residency in high-rise buildings to quickly increase house fund, save the land and create a modern face for the urban life.
Moreover, when the economy further develops, people’s living standard will also be raised, strongly growing the demands for high-end apartments, recreation and entertainments, which will positively influence the development of the Company’s business operation.
On the contrary, when the economy stagnates, it will cause negative effects on the business operation of the Company in particular and on the real estate trading in general.
However, with the current economic growth of Vietnam, it can be judged that economic risks are not big to the Company’s operation.
Legal Risks
The Legal system of Vietnam is not fully complete and the implementation feasibility is not high.
In addition, there still exit many complicated and overlapping administrative regulations, including regulations on land and real estate trading field, which considerably impacts the property trading of the Company.
The changes in laws and administration procedures will directly influence the feasibility and progress of the Company’s projects.
Nonetheless, with the common tendency of the economy, the Government is also gradually completing the legal system in order to simplify the administrative procedures, meeting the more and more pressing demands for accommodation of people.
Thus, although the legal factors relating to land and real estate trading issues directly affect the business operation of the Company, the legal risks hardly influence its operation due to the Government’s efforts to make positive changes in line with the country’s development.
Competition Risks
As real estate trading is an area of high potential, more and more enterprises are entering the market.
The Company’s competitors are not only domestic enterprises but also foreign ones with sound financial capacity.
However, with Vincom’s advantages of its brand name, proven opportunity identification capacity, understanding of legal procedures, management capacity as well as land and financial potentials, Vincom JSC can be confident in its competitiveness with domestic and foreign firms.
In general, the increasing number of competitors will reduce Vincom’s market share, however, with its available advantages, the Company is capable of controlling these risks and, step by step, expand its key business activity.
Integration risks
Vietnam’s official entrance to WTO is also a long-term factor affecting the Company’s business operation.
The opener policies for foreign investors upon the integration will create favorable conditions for the foreign investors to join Vietnam real estate market, who will become direct rivals of domestic enterprises, including Vincom JSC.
On the other hand, Vincom JSC has a big opportunity in which there is a strong growth in the demands for apartments and offices when the integration happens, as well as other opportunities of cooperating with foreign partners to launch big projects at international level.
These will help Vincom enhance its business and management capacity, which will generate the highest economic efficiency for the Company.
With such opportunities and challenges, Vincom JSC has well equipped itself with management capacity, business strategies, step by step improved its financial potential to proactively seize opportunities and to run the business in line with the new situation.
Business Risks
The main business activities of Vincom JSC are currently focusing on the Vincom City Towers (VCT), which have been approximately 100% exploited so the Company does not have the potential for higher growth.
However, it is not really a disadvantage for Vincom JSC thanks to the followings:
The office and retail space rents applied by Vincom are currently lower than those of other companies in the same field.
Thus, there is a high possibility that the rents will be increased to the average market price.
A part from the VCT, Vincom JSC is generating revenue from Vincom Park Place Project via the PFV Investment and Commerce Joint Stock Company, in which Vincom holds 74.41% owner’s equity.
Vincom is also accelerating the construction progress of the Vincom Complex of Commerce and Services Center, Hotel, Offices, Luxury Apartments and Underground Parking Place in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City and plans to open the Vincom Centre (area B of the Project) in April 2010.
In addition, the Company is launching other property projects that have a big development potential.
With the above reasons, the business risks that might limit the development potential of the Company are considerably minimized.
Foreign Exchange Risks
In recent years, thanks to the monetary stabilizing policy of the State, the exchange rates between VND and other strong currencies are quite stable with rather low fluctuation, the short-term exchange rates forecast is not very difficult.
Thus, the impacts of the exchange rates fluctuation on the Company’s operation is inconsiderable.
Moreover, most of Vincom’s partners are foreign companies, its revenue in foreign currencies is very big, meanwhile, except for the procurement of specialized equipments and tools, most of
Vincom’s expenses are in VND, which help mitigate the losses caused by exchange rate fluctuation.
Other Risks
Such other risks as acts of God, market fluctuations, enemy-inflicted destructions, fire... are force majeure that will cause damages and losses to the assets, humans and the general operation of the Company.

– Consolidated Financial Reports of 2007, 2008, 2009
Despite the difficult context of the world and domestic economies, the Compnay has gained positive business results with its profit  over the target.
The Company’s main business activity, which is the leasing-out of office and shopping mall, remains quite steady.
The opening of Vincom 2 (Vincom Park Place) in August 2009 with an occupancy rate of 100% has increased the leasing income by 20% against 2008.
Factors influencing the business operations of the Company for the past 2 years
In 2008 and 2009, the global financial crisis caused severe impacts on the economy of many countries.
The world, in general, and Vietnam, in particular, are in the comprehensive downturn in all aspects of the production and business.
However, looking from the positive perspectives of the gloomy picture of the economy, these difficulties, both internal and external, are bringing new opportunities to Vietnam and its enterprises.
a. 	Disadvantages Objective
The global economic crisis and downturn have caused direct and indirect impacts on the Vietnam’s economy generally and on enterprises specifically.
2009 is a fluctuating year, in which the crisis of the financial market led to the economic downturn worldwide.
The restraints on credit growth speed by end the year 2009 forced banks to limit their home loan and corporate property investment loans.
These actions affected the real estate market, especially in the apartment and house segment etc., indirectly causing greater difficulties to a lot of property developers.
A lot of new big property projects in the neighboring areas of Hanoi were approved and started.
The securities market suffered from a deep decline and there was a low liquidity.
Foreign investors withdrew from the market, making the mobilization from this securities channel (shares and bonds) became hard.
Hardly had the real estate market’s “iceberg” melted than negative and complicated changes occurred.
Subjective
In the same boat like many other Vietnamese enterprises, the Company has to face with the crisis and suffers from the crisis’ impacts on its business operation.
The Company has to face with the pressure of a nonstop growing demands for investment capital when the inflation keeps rising.
b. 	Advantages Objective
The office market in Hanoi in 2009 did not have big changes as the supply is lower than the demand, especially in the first four inter-city districts.
The retail market in Vietnam is the most promisingly attractive market to foreign investors thanks to its advantages of a young population and a big source of idle funds.
The retail market pressures, especially when Vietnam is going to let this field open, have raised the rent, while there are not many new shopping malls in Hanoi.
Thanks to Vietnam’s integration into WTO and its opening of retail market since early 2009, a lot foreigners will come and live in Vietnam, which will boost the demands for serviced apartments.
The supply of apartments, especially the highend ones still does not meet the demand.
Individual investors have started to buy apartments to lease them out to expatriates.
This is the market providing houses for foreigners but it also boost sale of apartments.
The inflation early 2008 made prices escalate, however, prices have been stabilized since 2009, even lower than the average expense, especially the prices of construction materials.
Subjective
VCT is located in the centre of the city with convenient traffic.
This is also the only complex in Hanoi offering package services: retail centre, entertainment and office.
High quality service and competitive rents are the reasons for the absolute and stable occupancy rate of the building.
Vincom is a prestigious brand name, which is affirmed in the market in general and in the real estate market field in particular.
Vincom’s property projects are located in the centre of big cities.
The Vincom Park Place Building in Hanoi (connecting with VCT) officially came into operation in August 2009, and the construction of Vincom Centre in District 1 is on schedule and is to be opened soon.
Vincom’s current projects are high-end property ones, having prime location so they are not much suffering from the sharp decline of property prices.
The Company’s positionmcompared with that of others in the same industry
The Company’s position in its industry
 Vincom City Towers
Vincom City Towers are becoming more and more attractive to and liked by people, especially the young ones.
No other trade center in Hanoi can have such a perfect combination of high quality shopping, entertainment and restaurants like at Vincom Center.
Above all, this place also offer office space with varied amenities and high security.
The perfect combination of the 6 floors on the podium as a retail space, offering a wide variety of goods, restaurants and entertainment, with the 15 floors on the towers serving as the high-end offices has optimized the convenience for the two blocks, creating the towers themselves a position that no other building in Hanoi can have.
Megastar cinema complex: This is currently the most modern cinema complex with 10 multifunctional international standard projection rooms.
This cinema complex has produced resonant effects and support for the trade center and brought Vincom a firm competition position in Hanoi that other buildings are unable to have in 2-3 years.
 Office areas
With a total office area of 50,000m2, Vincom is seen as one of the biggest office building in Hanoi with the management and consultancy provided by CBRE.
With the central location, the Building obviously has a more competitive advantage over others existing or to be constructed in the future.
 Vincom Park Place
Vincom Park Place (the 25-floor complex of retail center and high-end apartments) was developed by the PFV Investment and Trade Joint Stock Company, in which Vincom holds 74.41% charter capital.
Its construction commenced in early 2008 and the Vincom 2 Trade Center officially came into operation in August 2009.
Special construction standards were applied for this 25-floor building, which comprises of high-class luxurious apartments and a penthouse, luxurious shopping mall, and sufficient services of a high-end apartment building in the centre of Hanoi.
 The Project “Office and apartments for sales, 5-star hotel and Trade Center” in District 1, HCMC (Eden Project)
In HCMC, Vincom JSC continues to haul itself up by officially obtaining the permission to be the investor of the two land lots in the centre of the City.
This area has beautiful landscape, compatible technical infrastructure, and is surrounded by a number of cultural works, office buildings, big and most luxurious hotels and shopping malls of the City.
The land at 66-68-70 Le Thanh Ton has there facades: one on Le Thanh Ton street, one on Hai Ba Trung street and one on Ly Tu Trong Street, with a total area in excess of 7,000m2; the land area for Eden Trade Center has 4 facades: one on Le Loi Street, one on Dong Khoi Street, one on Le Thanh Ton Street, and the rest in on Nguyen Hue Street with a total area of 8,800m2.
The Company is developing this place into a leading property complex in Vietnam with the best design idea and quality.
Rivals
a. On retail market
 In Hanoi
Besides existing rivals (Trang Tien Plaza, BigC Thang Long, Opera Business Centre, Ruby Plaza...), Vincom JSC will have to compete with a lot of other rivals in the coming years.
According to the statistics of CBRE, by end of 2009, the retail space in Hanoi had exceeded 100,000m2.
Total supply of retail market does not change compared to Quarter III 2009, however, CBRE expects, in 2010, the market will have 38,500m2 of retail space more from the Hanoi City Complex, of which construction has been resumed, restructured Trang Tien Plaza and Grand Plaza, of which 50% space has been leased.
By 2011, an area of approximately 700,000m2 will be added to the current supply source.
Main problems will lie in the lack of quality retail space and in the procedures and issues relating to obtaining permissions.
In terms of business scale and area, the supply of shopping malls has considerably increased due to the appearance of 6 new places: Syrena, Hapro Department Store, Hà Thành Plaza, Parkson, The Garden, Artex Building and Kinh Do Tower.
With a vancy ratio of 0.4%, most of these shopping centres operated effectively in 2009.
7 out of 10 big shopping centres in Hanoi are fully occupied.
In addition, Vincom is striving to further develop and gain more successes, especially thanks to the following advantages:
Prime location;
Reasonable rent;
High quality and professional service.
 In Ho Chi Minh City
Vincom JSC is opening the Vincom Center Building in the centre of Ho Chi Minh
City (Le Thanh Ton Street, District 1) on 30th April 2010, which is seen as its official
exploitation of HCMC real estate market.
Although the Company has a late entrance to the market compared to other rivals like Diamond Plaza, Parkson Le Thanh Tong,
Saigon Trade Center, Zen Plaza… Vincom Center’s occupancy rate has reached 85%.
The results of the survey conducted by CBRE Vietnam about the retail market shows that, the retail market in HCMC currently has approximately 493,000m2 for all types.
More than 40,000m2 of trade center was supplemented to the market in Quarter IV of 2009, and most of these additional spaces were quickly occupied, including Kumho Asiana Plaza, Saigon Square 2, Parkson the Flemington.
The rent of retail space in the centre area may continue to go up in 2010 due to the shortage of supply.
This is a favorable condition for appearance of Vincom Centre in HCMC.
Prospects of the Industry
The global financial crisis, which started in 2008 and lasted until the end of 2009, has caused severe impacts on the economies worldwide.
Many big brand names, including huge financial institutions collapsed.
Most of Vietnamese enterprises, particularly those in the real estate trading, have severely suffered from the crisis.
Despite of the gloomy picture of the world economy, looking from the positive perspectives, these difficulties, both internal and external, are bringing new opportunities to Vietnam and its enterprises.
 Office for lease
The impacts of the economic crisis together with the considerable increase in the demand for office space have resulted in a temporary surplus demand in all market segments (Offices Grade A, B and C).
There is a keen competition to retain customers and increase space for rent among buildings.
A large number of big companies, mainly local ones, are trying to search for offices to lease for long term and at reasonable rent.
To enhance their competitiveness, new projects are offering lower rents.
If rents offered by new buildings Grade A and B+, which have good locations, are going down, customers are forecasted to consider moving their offices due to a bigger saving of office rent than office relocating costs.
In HCMC, the real estate activities are recovering together with the banking and finance sector, which grows the demands for office space in central areas.
A large number of offices Grade A have been transacted.
Such big buildings as Sai Gon Centre, KumHo Asiana Plaza offer average rents of USD50-55m2/month with a revision of 1.23% each quarter for offices Grade A. Most of the property developers still keep the rent at USD40 – 45/m2/month as they believe the worst time is over.
The Grade A building Kumho Asiana Plaza’s opening in Quarter III 2009 has provided 31,562m2 more for the market.
Kumho Asiana Plaza has been positioned as a high-end building, competitive to the Metropolitan.
No building Grade B was completed in Quarter III/2009.
Seven office buildings Grade C were completed in Quarter III, which provides 37,049m2 of floor area more to the market, and are mainly in the areas that already have a number of office buildings Grade C: District 3, Phu Nhuan District, Tan Binh District and District 5.
In Quarter IV 2009, the supply of new office space was influenced by offices Grade C with 13 new buildings were completed.
The supply of Grade C increased by approximately 38,000m2 of floor area (about 29,000m2 net).
No buildings Grade A or B were put into operation during this Quarter.
Total new net office space for lease of all grades reached 50,000m2, an increase of 1.5% against the previous quarter, in which:
New net leasing area – Grade A: 9,000 m2
New net leasing area – Grade B: 13,000 m2
New net leasing area – Grade C: 28,000 m2
The vacancy rate of office space of all grades was 14.5% by end of Quarter IV.
The average rent offered by the seven office buildings Grade A was USD40.4m2/month, a decline of 2.2% against the previous quarter.
The needs for office space kept rising.
The demand in Quarter IV 2009 increased by 20% compared to the previous Quarter.
The extension of lease contracts of existing lessees accounts for most of successful transactions of offices Grade A in the last Quarter.
Demands for offices Grade B and C are mainly of Vietnamese firms.
Prospects: It is expected that more than 350,000m2 of floor area will be completed in 12 months.
Rents are forecasted to decline due to the existing big gap in the offering rents and transacting rents.
Market advantages still belong to lessees.
A residual floor area of approximately 130,000m2 of 2009 plus the new floor area will force office developers brainstorm new operational orientation.
Vietnamese firms will be the key factor of most of the transactions – mainly joint stock and stateowned companies.
Leasing transactions will continue to focus on offices of 150 – 300m2.
A number of large transactions are still recognized by foreign-owned companies  which are expanding their operation.
In Hanoi, the statistics by CBRE shows the office for lease market as at Quarter IV 2009 as follows:
In Quarter IV/2009, there is a building Grade A – BIDV Tower and 3 buildings Grade B – Vinaconex Tower, CMCTower and Vinaconex 9 coming into operation with a total supply of net office area for lease 43,000m2.
In October 2009, two another office building started to be built: the FLC Landmark Tower on Le Duc Tho Street (construction commencing on 15 October), and the Lotte Hanoi Centre (previously known as Hanoi City Complex, construction commencing on 22 October) with the respective net area for lease of 11,000m2 and 40,000m2.
The supply of offices Grade A in 2008 caused a vacancy rate of 11% in this segment with a new supply of 10,120m2.
The vacancy rate of offices Grade B increased to 18.04%, an increase of 3.04% against the previous quarter.
The rents of both segments A and B slightly decline respectively by 2.3% and 1.18% against the previous quarter to USD43.71/m2/month and USD25.89/m2/month
From now to the middle of 2010 and 2011, more office projects Grade A will be completed.
In the next 2 years, the office market for lease in Hanoi will expect no stability because most of the markets, especially the new buildings will have to face with the continuation of rent depressurizing as there is no sign that the rents will decrese in the next 2 years.
There will be competitions between the developers of BIDV Towers and Capital Tower (where offices Grade B are located), which is coming into operation the next quarter.
A number of other buildings opening in Quarter II of 2010 include:
Excalibur Building, Charmvit Plaza.
Keangnam Hanoi is to be open by end of 2011.
 Retail market
The Retail market in Vietnam is assessed to be of great development potential.
In 2009, although the economy had to face with a lot of difficulties, retail gained considerable growth rates.
As per the evalutions of the the Domestic Market Regulating Group of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the total retail of goods and social services is estimated to reach VND1,197.480billion, an increase of 18.6% against 2008.
The retail market is currently dividing evenly to all of the locations having all the criteria for wholesale activities.
Thus, most of the houses on the street-front are big retail supply.
A lot of shops on big streets have been repairing and upgrading their facility conditions to meet the growing leasing demands.
According to the surveys of market research companies, a lot middle-class and highclass brand names have entered Vietnam market such as Naf Naf, Morgan de Toi, Mexx, Aldo, Hard Rock Café, Debenhams.
In HCMC, there is a clear separation in the commercial space market between the inter-city and satellite areas because the retail system is still focusing at the centre of the City.
According to CBRE’s survey, many trade centers in the neighboring areas are attracting customers while those in the centre are filled up right from the opening days at a rate of 80%.
By early 2010, the ratio of vacant area of commercial centre is 5.3%, an increase of 0.9% compared to Quarter III 2009.
Total retail floor area exploited by Debenhams is
256,025m2, the average occupancy rate is approximately 95%.
According to CBRE’s assessment, in 2009, the market rent on retail market declined sharply compared to 2007 and 2008.
Rents at good locations in the centre of the City range from USD99/m2/month to 250USD/m2/month.
In 2010, floor area of retail space in the centre will increase by 65,050m2 when Vincom Centre and Bitexco Financial projects are brought into operation.
CBRE forecasts that the rents offered in the centre will tend to go up due to the nondecreasing demands.
On the contrary, the floor area of the out-of-centre areas will tend to decrease.
During the past two years, the supply of retail space has doubled.
However, according to the market survey and forecast by 2013, the supply of retail space in HCMC will double as it is now to 740,000m2, in which that in the out-ofcentre areas will increase by 50% right in 2010 and will be 7 times higher by 2013.
From now to 2013, HCMC will have a number of retail spaces brought into operation.
In 2010, The Everich of 24,000m2 will be open in HCMC, of which the lessee will be the Retail Group Lotte, who opens the second supermarket in HCMC.
Vincom Center, 48,000m2, is not opening until 30th April 2010, but 85% space has been occupied.
The Plemington – phase 2 with 7,500m2 on Le Dai Hanh Street (District 11) will be completed in Quarter IV, 2010; Bitexco Financial Tower of 20,000m2 (District 1) is opening in October 2010.
Sai Gon M&C of 23,000m2 (District 1) is expected to complete in 2010, Crescent Mall of 44,000m2 (District 7) will have it construction completed in Quarter IV 2010.
Others to be completed in 2011 include: Tan Phong Shopping Complex of 70,000m2 (District 7), Times Square of 14,566m2 (District 1).
Projects scheduled to complete in 2012 are: Royal Garden of 22,000m2, SJC Tower of 8,292m2 (District 1), Vincom Eden of 27,104m2 (District 1), Le Van Tam Underground Park of 30,904m2, Sunrise City of 70,000m2 (District 7).
And in 2013, HCMC will have: Platinum Plaza 140,000m2 in Binh Chanh District, Berjaya Financial Tower 186,464m2 (District 10), Promenada – phase 2 (Binh Duong).
If all of these commercial centre projects are on schedule, there will be an abundant supply of retail space in HCMC, which can “quench the thirst of the market”.
In Hanoi, Vincom Centre 2 (Vincom Galleries), a high-end trade center brought into operation in August 2009, has provided the market with 91,500m2 of retail space.
This Centre connects with the Vincom City Towers by overhead walkways in levels 3, 4 and 5, making themselves the largest shopping complex in the Capital.
A number of famous brand names including Repay and Dunlop have opened their shops here.
However, the number of such retail space is still limited so enterprises are still looking for other shops in the centre.
In Quarter IV, there was no additional retail space in Hanoi and the supply remained stable.
However, due to such a great demand for retail space in central areas, streetfront shops have been upgraded a lot.
It is expected that in 2010, Hanoi will have 38,500m2 of retail space more in the out-of-centre areas.
Rents in the centre areas remain stable and are expected to go up in 2010 when the demands keep growing and a lot of leasing contracts are expiring.
Local retailers are expanding their scale, in which the food and beverage sector witnesses the strongest expansion, and is followed by the mass opening of electronic shops at good locations and on big streets.
The occupancy rate is high: approximately 100% in the city centre and 69% its satellite areas.
The upgrading of street-front shops into modern retail space will cause pressure on the rent increase speed of retail space in commercial centers.
The upgrading of old markets into commercial Center will help improve the hygiene and food safety sand shopping habits of the people.
Once Trang Tien Plaza is improved, its rents will be as high as other competitors in the city centre.
The incomplete infrastructure and traffic will influence people’s shopping habits.
In the satellite areas, new trade centers will gradually come into stable operation when local and middle-class brand names take advantage of lower rents and most of the citizens are living in the West and South of the City.
The Company’s Development Orientation
With the completion of the Vincom City Towers (of which occupancy rate is approximately 100%), Vincom Park Place and Eden Project in HCMC, Vincom JSC has gained valuable experience in designing, constructing, operating, exploiting and managing complexes of trade center, office, high-end apartments for rent and hotels.
This is a firm foundation for the Company to consider further investing into these fields.

Location: The Eden Quadrant, the HCMC Department of Education and Training and the basement of Chi Lang Park; Total estimated investment: approximately VND8,257billion.

This area has a beautiful landscape, compatible technical infrastructure, and is surrounded by a number of cultural works, office buildings, big and most luxurious hotels and shopping malls of the City.
The land at 66-68-70 Le Thanh Ton has there facades: one on Le Thanh Ton street, one on Hai Ba Trung street and one on Ly Tu Trong Street, with a total area in excess of 7,000m2; the land area for Eden Trade Center has 4 facades: one on Le Loi Street, one on Dong Khoi Street, one on Le Thanh Ton Street, and the rest in on Nguyen Hue Street with a total area of 8,800m2.

On 15 October 2010, Vincom JSC and its consultant – CBRE, officially announced the commencement of the registration for the leasing at the Vincom Center Shopping Mall, a component of the said Project.
The Office, Service and Luxury Apartments area (Area B) is located on the land lot of which the pre-existing facility is the HCMC Department of Education and Training officially started to be built right after the Company obtained the Construction License.

The Company has all conditions to enhance its business operation in the coming time.

Vincom’s revenue in 2010 is expected to be comprised of: revenue from the leasing of VCT and the retail space of Vincom 2, revenue from the leasing of Area B of Eden Project (Vincom Center) in HCMC, which is expected to occur from May 2010, revenue from Vincom’s subsidiaries.
The revenue and profit in 2010 are estimated to be lower than those of 2009 due to the legalities of the Eden Project in HCMC.
In 2010, the Company has not yet acknowledged the revenue from the property sale (of the luxury apartments) as in 2009.
Evaluation by the Consulting Institution of the Profit and Dividend Plans
As a professional consulting institution, the Vincom Securities JSC has collected information, studied, analyzed and made assessments and forecasts about the business operation of Vincom JSC.
We find the revenue plan made by Vincom JSC reasonable due to the following reasons:
Although the real estate market has been suffering from a sharp decline caused by domestic and international economic changes, according to Savills Vietnam (a branch of the Savills, the world leading real estate service provider, of which securities are listed on the London Stock Exchange), the middle and long-term prospect for office still remains high.
The office renting in the centre areas does not tend to decrease until there is a considerable supply within the next 2-3 years.
The supply of office space Grade A in centre areas is still limited so the rents are still very high.
The office rent in the leading group of Grade A still stay at USD68/m2.
Meanwhile, although there is additional supply of office space Grade B (increasing by 17-18% in Quarters 2 and 3 of 2008), the supply of this grade is still insufficient.
With short leasing duration, flexibility and a wide variety of choices, commercial centers continue to affirm their positions in the office-for-lease market.
Vincom JSC is a leading firm in property trading, leasing of office and other entertainment services, with a firm position in the market and its good preparation for the future projects by its existing strengths, Vincom JSC is obviously capable of realizing their goals.
The updated results on revenue and profit in the Financial Report 2009 of the Company show that the net consolidated revenue of Vincom is VND1,974.446billion, approximately 7 times higher than 2008 thanks to the big revenue (of over 1,600billion dongs) from the sale of luxurious apartments at Vincom Park Place of its subsidiary – the PFV Investment and Trading JSC.
The profit after tax reaches more than 1,101billion dongs accordingly, an increase of 774% against 2008.
Regarding the profit plan of 2010, in our opinion, if there are no abnormal changes and force majeure that affect the Company’s operation, with the positive recovery prospect of the economy, the profit plan of Vincom is highly feasible and the Company can ensure the annual dividend ratio as planned.
We also find the planned dividend ratio of Vincom JSC reasonable, ensuring sufficient residual profit for re-investment in order to maintain the growing speed.
We would also like to notice that, the above evaluation and comments are given from the perspective of a consulting company, based in the selective information we have collected and based on the theory of securities finance with no intention of securing the securities value or the certainty of the forecasted figures.
These comments are just for reference for investors when they make decision on their own.

The location of the structure is in District 1 – the centre area of finance, services, diplomacy, culture, entertainment of the City and also the international tourism centre, which is functionalized as follows:
Centre of Administration and Diplomacy: mainly from Le Thanh Ton St.
to Dien Bien Phu St.
with the Le Duan Boulevard serving as the backbone.

d. 	Investment reasons
The Vietnam economy is growing strongly, which will improve the income and living standards of people.
Vietnam is becoming the destination for foreign investors and tourists, which lead to a high increase in the demands for housing, hotels and office space.
With a population of 84 million people, young average age and big consumption demand, Vietnam is an attractive retail market.
HCMC is a leading active economic centre of the country, located in the South East economic development triangle, thus, the demands for commercial centers, high-end apartments, hotels, park places are growing while the supply is still insufficient.
e. 	Investment goals
This Project is to:
Affirm the obvious tendency of commerce in the development of the market economy, especially in HCMC, one of the leading commercial centers of the country, where supermarkets, big retail centers are replacing small and mobile markets.
Respond to the needs of offices, high-end apartments for lease of both local and foreign enterprises and citizens.
Moreover, the Project will meet the demands for hotels of tourists and those who are on short-term secondment in HCMC.
Develop an underground parking place of approximately 60,000m2.
This is a positive factor helping solve the overload of static traffic.
In big cities, the traffic density grows faster than the development of roads (12 – 15% faster than the development of roads) while vacant land areas in these cities are limited, therefore, the development of this automatic car parking system is the optimal solution to the static traffic planning in the future.
Enjoying and further improving the experience that the Company gains from the previous projects, this Projects will apply state-of-the-art technologies for the technical management system of the building, such as electricity, water, monitoring cameras, telecommunication, television and the Internet etc.
as per its investment goals and the aim of providing most modern facilities and professional services of international standards to users.
The Project will be designed by well-know local and international designers and constructed with good materials, by skilled workers so that users can totally feel secure about the construction quality.

Offices for lease: The need in offices in Hanoi is growing sharply, especially in the centre area.
More and more local and int’l enterprises companies are being established here.
In 2008 and 2009, the world economy in general and the Vietnam economy in particular were in a severe downturn, causing a lot of difficulties to the offices for lease market.
However, the recent economic recovery signs promise a strong development of the market in a near future in line with the common tendency of the economy.
Commercial centers: Hanoi currently has six large commercial centers with an aggregate of 43,000m2.
All of these commercial centers are assessed to operate quite effectively.
People are tending to do shopping and open their retail shops in commercial centers.
With a forecast of stability and a mid-term growth for the economy, the commercial centers market will recover and further develop.
Apartments for lease: There are currently 32 buildings Grade A to C with 1,622 apartments for lease.
While the need for apartments for lease is boosting, there is a lack of apartments.
That more and more foreigners are pouring into Vietnam owing to the FDI source flow together with the expansion of companies, the development of international relations have caused pressure on supply of apartment for lease.
Apartments for sale: The demand for apartments is increasing steadily and is forecasted to increase strongly in the coming time when the economy has become stable and reached a positive growth rate.
The demand for Grade A and high-end apartments in the city centre increase the fastest and will continue to increase when the urbanization process is faster.
The changes in life style and opinions about accommodation of people, especially of the young ones and those who have good income, will quickly boost the apartments for sales, especially the high-end ones.
