MESSAGE FROM
THE CHAIRMAN
Currently, in the field of high-rise and super high-rise building, Hoa Binh is considered to be the Vietnamese contractors with best capacity to meet the highest requirements of the market.
In 2015, Hoa Binh has received numerous awards and honors including the notable Top 50 largest brand value accredited by Brand Finance, an U.K international consultancy company.
Dear Shareholders,
In 2015, the real estate market has changed and impacted to the company business positively.
However, our expected business performance was not hit, in which net revenue reached VND 5,078 billion, increased 44.5% compared to 2014, and approximately 95.8% compared to the plan.
In 2015, profit after tax of the parent company’s shareholder was VND 83.5 billion, increased 28.4% compared to 2014, and approximately 46.4% compared to the plan.
The targeted after-tax profit was not obtained due to some objectives and subjective reasons: Firstly, the costs in some projects were not well managed.
There was also the support for the customers when calculating arisen costs.
Secondly, the debt collection was not successfully controlled.
We have shared the difficulties with the investors.
Thirdly, some of profits from real estate have not been accounted.
Fourthly, the restructure process of parent company and some of subsidiaries did not bring the improvement and effectiveness as expected.
Although the planned after-tax profit was not archived, our great development was successfully initiated with extremely encouraging outcomes: Company management system has been increasingly improved; Technical expertise is getting more important steps, work quality has been increasingly improved; trust, customer appreciation and brand reputation of Hoa Binh are increasingly well-defined.
Currently, in the field of high-rise and super high-rise building, Hoa Binh is considered to be the Vietnamese contractors with best capacity to meet the highest requirements of the market.
In 2015, Hoa Binh has received numerous awards and honors including the notable Top 50 largest
brand value accredited by Brand Finance, an U.K international consultancy company.
We have been entrusted by customers to implement more and more large-scale contracts, with high technical and aesthetic requirements in which it was previously implemented by the world-class contractors from the developed countries.
In recent quarter I/2016, we were very excited to win contract and started building more new projects with a total value of over VND 4,000 billion.
Up to now, the total value of the remaining contracts which will be carried out is over VND 15,000 billion.
In the field of investment, Hoa Binh has been granted investment certificates of Hoa Binh Innovation Center and Up to now the area of 2.5 hectares (24,512m2) in the heart of Saigon Hi-Tech Park, District 9, Ho Chi Minh City.
This strategic long-term investment aims to facilitate the Research and Development (R&D) to successfully access, develop and modernize the construction technology, improve the business performance and make more contribution to the construction industry’s development.
Surely, it will facilitate Vietnam construction industry to go on-spar with development of the world construction industry and become a spear-head economic sector of the country .
Dear Shareholders,
2016 will witness Hoa Binh’s great effort to successfully	improve	its	entire	international -standardized governance system.

Report of Business Activities in 2015
2015 witnessed HBC’s high revenue and profit growth rate (revenue and after-tax profit increased 44.5% and 28.4%, respectively) thanks to the Company’s development in terms of operation coverage and active focus on developing the civil engineering segment as its strength.
EVAlUAtION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES:
2015 witnessed HBC’s high revenue and profit growth rate (revenue and after-tax profit increased 44.5% and 28.4%, respectively) thanks to the Company’s development in terms of operation coverage and active focus on developing the civil engineering segment as its strength.
However, the index of effectiveness in corporate governance fall (gross profit ratio decreased from 11.7% to 5.8%).
The Board of Management recognized that the company needs to continue to develop the corporate governance system, including risk management system,	business	process	improvement	and management, as well as urgently implementing the activities of internal control department.
Moreover, the successor site managers should be strengthened to develop through training course to improve their leadership skills and qualification to archive the harmonious revenue and profit growth which is well matched with other companies in the industry.
BUSINESS
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS IN 2015:
Net sales in 2015: VND 5,078 billion, equivalent to 95.8% of the plan.
Profit after tax of parent company in 2015: VND83.47 billion, equivalent to 46.4% of the plan.
** Reasons for not fulfilling the target revenue:
+     Consolidated     financial     statements     excluded VND240.5 billion in sales of construction works: VND132.8 billion of the Ascent; VND107.7 billion of Green Park project, because Tien Phat and HBH did not all handover apartments to customers.
Moreover, revenue of T2 Noi Bai project decreased VND33.6 billion due to the settlement project revenue is not excluded EOT expenses.
+ Some construction works that delayed schedule such as: Saigon South Office Building.
- The responsibility for the failure in completing the business plan: The Board of Management recognized its responsibility for uncompleted business plan in many years according to the approved resolution of shareholders’ meeting.
It is the heavy responsibility for shareholders and company’s staffs and relates to dividends and bonuses in the financial year.
Furthermore, unsatisfactory business results might influence on the awareness of the investors towards HBC shares.
Accordingly, the price in stock market does not reflect the true value of shares.
This will make the difficulties for the plan of capital increase, share issuing for strategic shareholders to obtain the company’s sustainable development.
The Board of Management urgently reviewed the weaknesses that lead to the decrease in gross profit as well as suggested the urgent solutions (For more details in Action Plan, see page 57).
** Reasons for not fulfilling the targeted profit:
+ A decrease in gross profit margin: 2015 was recorded with some heavy lost construction works such as:
* VND125.1 billion loss from Vietinbank Tower project: due to the collaboration between investors and advisors is not synchronized, the construction plans of large blocks and problems required by main contractor were delayed which led to increased costs.
Although the project got loss but we had the opportunity to approach new technologies in order to obtain the valuable experiences in constructing the international-level projects.
Vietinbank Tower project helped Hoa Binh to affirm that Vietnamese contractor has the good ability to meet the highest requirements in high-rise and super-high-rise sector.

Annual Report 2015 sustainable Value
* SSG Tower project suffered VND28.7 billion losses: problems arisen led to debt collection, due to prolonged construction time compared to the planned schedule, thereby wage, machine and equipment costs increased; There are some issues which delayed the payment.
+ Some subsidiaries, affiliates which are in the period of discontinued operation or restructuring activities; in which MHB suffered such negative profit of VND13.3 billion, Vita lost VND1.5 billion, HBP Hung Yen lost VND1.5 billion, AHA lost VND4.2 billion, Golden Lotus Securities Company lost VND2 billion.
+ Some business activities in real estate, real estate brokerage, leasing office were inefficient and affected by the real estate revenue which has not been recognized while the cost was recorded, as Tien Phat lost VND16.3 billion, HBH lost VND38.4 billion (it is expected that over the next year, these companies will record revenue of real estate projects sold in 2015, increasing profit is expected to be VND26.7 billion).
+ In the consolidated report, gross profit was excluded the construction works of the Ascent, equivalent to VND23.4 billion; Green Park project of VND6.1 billion, due to Tien Phat and HBH did not handover apartments to customers (these amounts will be recorded as profit for the year after, as Tien Phat and HBH will record all real estate revenue of the Ascent & Green Park).
+ In the consolidated report, earnings isexcluded for the contracts between affiliated companies which had not yet been sold out out of the system in terms of profit-excluded inventories, reducing profit of VND10.5 billion, including Hung Yen with parent company HBC: VND5.3 billion; HBA - Tien Phat with VND264 million; Tien Phat and HBH of VND4.9 billion.
(These amounts will be recorded as profit for the next year, after HBC record construction revenue of the body of Vietinbank Tower, while Tien Phat will record real estate revenues the Ascent).

The positive development is recognized in the domestic construction industry.
Especially, in the segment of residential construction where Hoa Binh has many advantages.
Besides, the business plan for the financial year 2016 is based on the analysis of market factors and internal characteristics of HBC.
The CBRE’s insight report unveiled that Vietnam has the opportunity to break out in 2016 with foreign investment continued to be the driving force for the development of the economy.
As reported by the Ministry of Finance, 66% of Vietnam’s exports are generated by FDI.
These companies contributed 22% and 26% to the GDP and the Government budget, respectively.
Realized capital value in 2015 was estimated at $14 billion, up 12% compared to 2014.
FDI is expected to increase in most industries, especially textiles, construction, banking, high-tech and real estate thanks to TPP agreement which will be signed early in 2016.

In Southeast Asia, the increasing presence of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will enhance the image of Vietnam domestically and internationally.
AEC was officially formed on 01.01.2016.
Vietnam is currently ranked No.
2 in value of FDI received in Asia, just behind China.
Young population and low labor costs are important factors in attracting foreign investment.
Real estate bounced back strongly after 2014 due to inflation and low interest rates, along with the support from sources of foreign investment.
As a result, mortgage credit has been strengthened and expected to increase 18% - 20% compared to the same period last year, faster than the average growth rate of 14% - 15% in the period 2012-2014 when the background of economic growth slowed down.
House loan rate in 12/2015 was currently 8.4%, lower than the average interest rate of 9.87% of the previous quarter and 11.2% in 2007.

Interest rates is expected to increase slightly in 2016, while inflation is expected to stabilize within the allowable range, but due to the impact of the Fed which is raising interest rates for the first time after a decade (though, as of 3/2016, the Fed has not yet announced raising interest rates).
Vietnam Dong value is unlikely to decrease due to the impact of raising interest rates of the Fed, because this impact has been reflected in the present value of the currency.
However, Vietnam Dong remains to be an important factor to keep an eye on in 2016, because by the end of 2015, the State Bank announced to apply a new exchange rate adjustment mechanism which is heavily relied on the market.
Accordingly, the exchange rate will fluctuate more closely to market volatility, especially fluctuations related to macroeconomic issues, supply and demand, and the impacts of other significant currencies.
2. thE RECOVERy OF StOCK MARKEt
Unlike oil and gold prices, the stock market is expected to recover in 2016.
The stock market is expected to reach 650-670 in 2016, thanks partly to the real estate stocks which accounts for 10% of the stock market.
In addition, oil prices have stopped falling, reducing pressure on the oil companies.
The decline in gold price, though not as drastic as oil prices, is expected to continue in 2016 and reaches the bottom in the next year before seeing any recovery.

Public debt as % of GDP has increased from 51.7% in 2010 to 60.3% today.
As of 12.31.2015, the public debt was 61.3% of GDP Vietnam.
Some of the factors hide behind the rapid increase in debt:

(B) Domestic bond market strengthened conditions for the issuance of additional and
• Bad debt situation
In 2015, only a small part of the bad debt was swapped away in which VAMC has been processed.
Meanwhile, bad debts’ objective in 2016 is also very modest.
This leads to a concern that bad debts that VAMC swapped increases in long term, this situation is not sustainable.

(C) Low interest rates since 2011 has allowed the government to release more short-term loans.
Fiscal environment in 2016 is less optimistic because gasoline prices fell which led to oil revenue reduction, which only contributed 12% of total revenue.
Accordingly, the public debt will be able to increase more than planned and hit the ceiling at the end of this year.
Although Vietnam is not remarkably affected by the currency crisis risk available in other areas, its trade flow may be affected in a certain period due to global currency crisis is continuing.

It is the rearrangement of division responsibility by using the “Matrix assignment” on the basis of the or-ganizational chart of the current field in the personnel direction “good at one thing, knowing more things “, meanwhile, implementation of staff rotation policy in management positions in the field is done to achieve the objective of” multitasking in the field, in-depth at the office.
- Interest rate risk: Currently, the ratio of debt / equity of HBC is relatively high.
Therefore, the increase in interest expense as well as the ability to access capital from the bank credit risks is considered significant in HBC’s business plan in the near future.
- The risk of inflation: The inflation caused great impact on the operation of enterprises, particularly the construction enterprises..
The sharp increase in raw materials and steel inputs (mentioned above), etc.
will cause significant impacts to the budget planning of the HBC.
- Legal risk: However, the bylaws system are still in the stage of modification and improvement with many terms which are changed and modified, these documents are currently lack of uniformity and consistency, so the capture and execution of the business will still faces many difficulties.
- Risk of raising and payment risk:: One of the events which drew concerns from real estate company in recent years is that the State Bank had introduced a draft circular on amending the Circular No.
36/2014 / TT -NHNN.
Accordingly, there are two noteworthy points that will affect the real estate market, including change in risk factor for property business loan from 150% to 250% and the rate of using short-term deposits to the long-term loans decreased from 60% to 40%.
If this regulation is adopted, the capital flows that banks use to lend to real estate investments will be limited.

REpORT OF BOARD OF SupERVISORS
I. SURVEIlANCE RESUltS tOWARDS
BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
In 2015, Board of Directors and Board of Management have implemented operating activities, management as stipulated in the Charter with high degree of cautious for the benefits of the Company in general and ben-efits of partners and shareholders in particular.
Board of Directors held 19 meetings, as detailed on page 91, belonging to the Report of Board of Directors to decide on important issues within its authority.. At the same time, the decisions of the Board of Directors, Board of Management have always adhered to the content as the resolution adopted by the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting 2015 for approval.
OPINIONS OF BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE
Board of Supervisors agrees with the financial data presented in the separate financial statements, consol-idated financial statements of the Company, have been audited by Ernst & Young Vietnam, as detailed from page 120 to page 171.
We also reviewed the entire annual report and agree with the contents of the Board of Management submitted to the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting.
However, we believe that Board of Management needs a deeper analysis of subjective reasons, in addition to objective reasons that not lead to achieving the basic financial indicators, especially profit targets by content submission from the Board of Directors, which was approved by the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting 2015.
From there, there are appropriate solution actions for each reason
SOME FINANCIAlANAlySIS INDICAtORS
The followings are some financial analysis indicators which Board of Supervisors believed that it is mean-ingful to the Board of Management and shareholders to analyze, compare and evaluate business perfor-mance and establish the link connection with the strategic orientation “became the main contractor, Design & Build general contractor”.
RECOMMENDAtIONS
Some above financial ratios unveiled the relatively low business performance obtained by the Company.
Board of Supervisors believed that business activities in 2015 as well as in previous years have been affected by two important factors:
Firstly, the governance system, the general process management, and construction management in particular has not been standardized and require more powerful solutions to business plans, especially ensure the implementation of 2016 profit plan, Board of Management should evaluate all the quality management systems that Company has applied in relation, eliminate redundant processes and not a practical nature.
On the other hand, the caused need to be analyzed in detail to the appropriate level of a corresponding solution which can be applied to the overall handling of the relationship between cause and solution.
Secondly, the Board of Management should study and clarify the concept of “main contractor, Design & Build general contractor”, the required conditions, the current conditions and development strategy relation to the feasible conditions.
Also, before going to the major decisions related to the business activities, the Board of Management should consider the relationship with the strategy “became the main contractor, leading Design & Build general contractor”.
Such as purchasing decisions of amortization in 2015, the investment project of Hoa Binh Innovation Center influences in connection with the strategic orientation.
As for the second factor, the Board of Supervisors assumed that to become the “main contractor, leading design & build general contractor”, these strategic activities need to focus on high caliber managing staffs in company level in general and construction management capabilities in particular.
Along with training activities, recruitment, the Company may have to consider large scale cut off in labor force directly to reducing the burden on capital management which is not really strong.
At the same time, building the capable subcontractor workforce with improving construction management, including direct construction workforces are subcontractors.
Management system in general, construction management capability in particular and defining strategic direction, consistently pursued the strategy are two key factors leading major impact on performance business over the years and in the futureshould be seriously considered by the Board of Management.
